QA Interview Test Overview
The role of QA in agile can involve both testing and development. The idea is that developers and testers must actively engage to deliver the code and complete the project as per the client's brief. QA helps to proactively address issues and potential bugs within an application during the development cycles
QA helps to proactively address issues and potential bugs within an application during the development cycles. It can also help address functionality, performance, or security issues. This will not only ensure stability of the application, but also bring down the testing efforts once the application lands in the hands of the users. In this way developers are able to move ahead without dealing relentlessly with pending issues or rework.
In AEM, we recently introduce this role with the objective to improve our software development process and quality as well. We encourage the candidate to understand the basic flow of software testing and at same time we look into the certified testers as well (not mandatory) e.g. ISTQB.
